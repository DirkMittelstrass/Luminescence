## Changes in version 0.9.17.9000-5 (2021-11-19)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `plot_RadioPlot()`

-   An additional line, e.g., `plot_RadialPlot(...,line = 1)` was not
    always drawn where the user expected it to be seen; fixed (#106,
    reported by Li Bo)
-   The radial z-scale did not always extend to the limits of the data,
    even if limits for the z-scale were set, leading to an odd graphical
    offset and unsuitable plots; fixed (reported by Christina Neudorf)
-   The plot now always draws the lower limit of the z-scale.
