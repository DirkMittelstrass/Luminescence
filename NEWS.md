# Changes in version 0.9.18.9000-31 (2022-01-09)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.0.5**

### Breaking changes

The S4 class `RLum.Data.Image` was heavily revised to strip
`'Luminescence'` of the dependency to the package `'raster'` and replace
the functionality with base R functions and objects. The `'raster'`
package came in at an early stage of `'Luminescence'` to handle image
data. However, most of its massive feature set was never used, but
`'raster'` caused a lot of trouble to many users in our automated tests
because of its own dependencies. Soon, `'raster'` will be retired and
replaced by an even more powerful package called `'terra'`. This was our
cue to make some serious changes instead of carrying this unfortunate
implementation in `'Luminescence'` forward.

-   Within the `RLum.Data.Image-class` image data are now stored in an
    `array` instead of a `RasterBrick` object.
-   The function `plot_RLum.Data.Image()` does not know any more about a
    plot type `plotRGB`. However, the standard raster plot was even
    improved. Please watch out, however, for changed arguments.
-   The image format import functions `read_SPE2R()` and `read_TIFF2R()`
    were modified to support the new class design.
-   The corresponding example dataset was updated.
