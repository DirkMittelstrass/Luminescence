# Changes in version 0.9.19.9000-8 (2022-02-24)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.0.5**

### New functions

-   `extract_ROI()`: Light-weighted function to extract pixel values
    from pre-defined regions-of-interest (ROI) from
    `RLum.Data.Image-class`, `array` or `matrix` objects and provide
    simple image processing capacity.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `plot_DRTResults()`

-   The plot messed with the `par()` settings, which was problematic if,
    for instance, a second x-axis was wanted; fixed.
-   The function examples were not anymore up-to-date; fixed.

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

-   Fixed a bug that let `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()` crash under very
    particular circumstances due to a wrong conditional statement.
-   If the count limits are oddly chosen, i.e. `limit_counts` is smaller
    than the actual number of counts on the z-scale, the function does
    not crash anymore but replaces the value with the lowest possible
    value.
-   The argument `box` for the plot `persp` now accepts `alternate` for
    customized plot without the box usually drawn around the plot.
-   The function now returns adjusted matrix used for the plotting
    regardless of whether the argument `plot` is set to `TRUE` or
    `FALSE`.
-   If the plot type is `persp`, the default, the “viewing
    transformation matrix” is returned as a attribute `pmat`. This can
    be further used in conjunction with the function `graphics::trans3d`
    to add additional information to the graphic.

#### `plot_FilterCombinations()`

-   The function returned a wrongly calculated optical density, using
    `log()` instead of `log10`; fixed.= Note: The filter shiny app was
    not immediately affected, because the values here were taken from a
    spreadsheet.
-   The output object is now invisible, since the main purpose of the
    function is to plot a graphic and not to return an object.
