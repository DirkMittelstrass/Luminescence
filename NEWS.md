## Changes in version 0.9.0 (2019-01-27)

### New functions

  - `convert_Wavelength2Energy()` Smooth and quick emission spectra
    conversion from wavelength to energy scales
  - `fit_EmissionSpectra()` Luminescence emission spectra deconvolution
  - `fit_OSLLifeTimes()` Fit and deconvolution of OSL lifetimes using
    off-time measurements, i.e. after the stimulation was switched off.
  - `plot_DRCSummary()` Summarise all dose-response curves from your SAR
    OSL analysis in one single plot.
  - `scale_GammaDose()` Scale the gamma dose rate considering
    layer-to-layer variations in soil radioactivity. Contributed by S.
    Riedesel and M. Autzen.
  - `fit_ThermalQuenching()` Provide an easy option to fit thermal
    quenching data and determine the activation energy.
  - `read_RF2R()` Add support for importing spatially resolved RF
    measurement results.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `apply_CosmicRayRemoval()`

  - Thanks to black magic, this function now runs also over a list of
    `RLum.Data.Spectrum` objects and and `RLum.Analysis` objects (also
    nested in a list)

#### `apply_EfficiencyCorrection()`

  - The function produced a warning (“collapsing to unique ‘x’ values”)
    on R-devel; fixed.

#### `analyse_SAR.TL()`

  - The plot legend was not correct, if no dose points had been
    provided; fixed
  - The function returned a confusion warning; fixed.
  - If background signals are provided, now the background subtracted
    signal is shown automatically instead of the uncorrected curves
    (suggestion by Tilmann Wolpert)
  - The function now supports a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects as input
  - The plot settings were sufficiently reset; fixed.
  - Code polish

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`

  - Enable support for data imported from a BIN/BINX-file.

#### `read_BIN2R()`

  - In the auto-file recognition (only a path instead of a file is
    provided), sometimes the found BIN/BINX-files were imported twice.
    The corresponding code was simplified to avoid such errors in
    future.

#### `read_XSYG2R()`

  - The function failed for R-devel importing spectrometer data
    (`approx(..., ties = -2)`); fixed.

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

  - The wavelength to energy scale conversion was not correct. This was
    corrected and internally, the function now calls consistently the
    new function `convert_Wavelength2Enegy()` (the corresponding code
    and documentation have been updated or removed).  
  - The function gained a new argument `norm` for normalising the data
    to the highest or the lowest count value.
  - The function gained a new argument `bg.spectrum` allow to pass a
    background spectrum that can be used for the subtraction
  - The function returned a warning if a single matrix was used but
    `plot.type` was already set to `single`; fixed.
  - Wrong settings in `bg.channels` crashed the function. Now it
    auto-corrects the wrong values.
  - Channel binning now consistently calls the internal function
    `Luminescence:::.matrix_binning()`, which is more efficient cleaner
    than the code used before
  - The function now longer crashes for `plot.type = 'persp'` if
    ’xaxis.energy = TRUE\`.
  - The colour picking option was not always working; fixed.
  - Warnings are formatted more nicely.

### Changes in S4-objects and methods

#### `RLum.Analysis-class`

  - The show-method crashed under very rare circumstances if
    inconsistent objects had been combined; fixed.

#### `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`

  - Support added for `bin_RLum.Data()`

### Internals

  - Package news are now provided as markdown document (NEWS.md) which
    is supported by CRAN
  - The package version numbering scheme has been modified to simplify
    the distinction between different developer versions. While relevant
    numbers for CRAN remain X.X.X, which reads ‘stable.major.minor’
    version, a 4th number indicates the running package build number,
    e.g., 0.9.0.7.
  - New internal function `Luminescence:::.matrix_binning()` to get the
    matrix (and curve) binning consistent; so far used only by the the
    `bin_RLum.Data()` method for `RLum.Data.Spectrum-class`
  - Vignette S4-class object structure updated
