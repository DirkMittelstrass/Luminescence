# Changes in version 0.9.19.9000-5 (2022-01-25)

**This package version requires R \>= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

-   Fixed a bug that let `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()` crash under very
    particular circumstances due to a wrong conditional statement.
-   If the count limits are oddly chosen, i.e. `limit_counts` is smaller
    than the actual number of counts on the z-scale, the function does
    not crash anymore but replaces the value with the lowest possible
    value.
-   The argument `box` for the plot `persp` now accepts `alternate` for
    customized plot without the box usually drawn around the plot.
-   The function now returns adjusted matrix used for the plotting
    regardless of whether the argument `plot` is set to `TRUE` or
    `FALSE`.
-   If the plot type is `persp`, the default, the “viewing
    transformation matrix” is returned as a attribute `pmat`. This can
    be further used in conjunction with the function `graphics::trans3d`
    to add additional information to the graphic.
