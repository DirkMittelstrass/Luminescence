**This package version requires at least R \>= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `read_BIN2R()`

-   The function crashed if it was run in a loop and encountered
    non-supported files; fixed.
-   The function does not crash anymore for zero-byte files but skips
    the import, returns a message and `NULL`.
