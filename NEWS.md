## Changes in version 0.9.16.9000-12 (2021-09-08)

**This package version requires at least R \>= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`

-   If run in a loop (e.g., with `lapply()`), merging of the results
    with `merge_RLum()` failed, because the returned objects were not
    always strictly identical; fixed.

#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()`

-   If all dose points were 0, the function crashed; fixed.

#### `read_BIN2R()`

-   The function crashed if it was run in a loop and encountered
    non-supported files; fixed.
-   The function does not crash anymore for zero-byte files but skips
    the import, returns a message and `NULL`.
-   For BINX files created using and EM-CCD camera the function created,
    under particular circumstances, invalid records that could not be
    further transformed; fixed (thanks to Anna-Maartje de Boer for
    reporting).
