# Changes in version 0.9.20.9000-7 (2022-03-28)

## Bugfixes and changes

### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`

-   Add support for `...` arguments `las` and `axes`

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

-   The `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` had
    two long-standing issues with the colour rug (both are fixed):
    -   The colour rug showed ugly overplotting,
    -   the colour rug had a resolution that depended on the x-axis
        (wavelength) scaling.
-   `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` now
    support a `...` parameter `box` for removing the outer plot frame.
    The argument was named `box` to avoid a confusion with the term
    frames used for image stacks.

## Internals

-   Add new internal function `.add_fancy_log_axis()` to provide a more
    sophisticated log-axis to plots if needed with minor ticks and
    proper labelling.
