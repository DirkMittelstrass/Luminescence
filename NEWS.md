## Changes in version 0.9.0 (2019-01-22)

### New functions

  - `convert_Wavelength2Energy()` Smooth and quick emission spectra
    conversion from wavelength to energy scales
  - `fit_OSLLifeTimes()` Fit and deconvolution of OSL lifetimes using
    off-time measurements, i.e. after the stimulation was switched off.
  - `plot_DRCSummary()` Summarise all dose-response curves from your SAR
    OSL analysis in one single plot.
  - `scale_GammaDose()` Scale the gamma dose rate considering
    layer-to-layer variations in soil radioactivity. Contributed by S.
    Riedesel and M. Autzen.
  - `fit_ThermalQuenching()` Provide an easy option to fit thermal
    quenching data and determine the activation energy.
  - `read_RF2R()` Add support for importing spatially resolved RF
    measurement results.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `apply_EfficiencyCorrection()`

  - The function prodced a warning (“collapsing to unique ‘x’ values”)
    on R-devel; fixed.

#### `analyse_SAR.TL()`

  - The plot legend was not correct, if no dose points had been
    provided; fixed
  - The function returned a confusion warning; fixed.
  - If background signals are provided, now the background subtracted
    signal is shown automatically instead of the uncorrected curves
    (suggestion by Tilmann Wolpert)
  - The function now supports a list of `RLum.Analysis` objects as input
  - The plot settings were sufficiently reset; fixed.
  - Code polish

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`

  - Enable support for data imported from a BIN/BINX-file.

#### `read_BIN2R()`

  - In the autofile recognition (only a path instead of a file is
    provided), sometimes the found BIN/BINX-files were imported twice.
    The corresponding code was simplified to avoid such errors in
    future.

#### `read_XSYG2R()`

  - The function failed for R-devel importing spectrometer data
    (`approx(..., ties = -2)`); fixed.

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`

  - The wavelength to energy scale conversion was not correct.
    Internally, the function now calls consistently the new function
    `convert_Wavelength2Enegy()`. The corresponding code and
    documentation have been removed.  
  - The function returned a warning if a single matrix was used but
    `plot.type` was already set to `single`; fixed.

### Internals

  - Package news are now provided as markdown document (NEWS.md) which
    is supported by CRAN
  - The package version numbering scheme has been modified to simplify
    the distinction between different developer versions. While relevant
    numbers for CRAN remain X.X.X, which reads ‘stable.major.minor’
    version, a 4th number indicates the running package build number,
    e.g., 0.9.0.7.
