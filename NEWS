NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.7.0 ( ,2016):

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_FadingMeasurement()’: Analysing fading measurements
           and calculating g-values

         • ‘analyse_portableOSL()’: The function analyses CW-OSL curve
           data produced by a SUERC portable OSL reader and produces a
           combined plot of OSL/IRSL signal intensities, OSL/IRSL
           depletion ratios and the IRSL/OSL ratio.

         • ‘calc_WodaFuchs2008()’: Function to obtain the equivalent
           dose using the approach proposed by Woda and Fuchs, 2008.

         • ‘PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()’: Converts an ‘RLum.Analysis’
           object produced by the function ‘read_PSL2R()’ to an
           ‘Risoe.BINfileData’ object (BETA).

         • ‘read_PSL2R()’: Imports PSL files produced by a SUERC
           portable OSL reader into R (BETA).

  Changes in S4-classes and methods:

         • Method ‘get_RLum’ for ‘RLum.Analysis’-objects did not
           respect ‘.pid’, fixed.

         • ‘plot_RLum’ was not passing the argument ‘sub’, as it was
           fetched by the partial argument matching; fixed.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • The combined dose response curves had been not scaled
               correctly, fixed.

  Internals:

         • The internal function converting BIN-file curves to
           RLum.Data.Curve() objects had been optimised and, amongst
           others, now uses a function written using Rcpp to create the
           curve matrix.  The conversion now works ca. 2 times faster,

         • add ‘`[<-]`’ method for ‘RLum.Data.Curve’ objects.
