NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.6.0 (,2016):

  New functions:

         • ‘plot_DetPlot()’: Plots the equivalent dose (De) in
           dependency of the chosen signal integral (cf. Bailey et al.,
           2003; #23).

  Removed functions:

         • ‘readBIN2R()’, replacement ‘read_BIN2R()’,

         • ‘readSPE2R()’, replacement ‘read_SPE2R()’,

         • ‘readXSYG2R()’, replacement ‘read_XSYG2R()’,

         • ‘writeR2BIN()’, replacement ‘write_R2BIN()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Curve()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Image()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Results()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Curve()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Image()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Analysis()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Results()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Data.Curve’, replacement
           ‘.Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Data.Curve’ The function was made
           an internal function, as this function was used only rarely
           by users, but often needed internally. The function and its
           functionally is still available under its new name but a lot
           of integrity checks had been removed from the code, which
           doubles the speed when transforming objects, but makes the
           function failing fast.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘calc_FadingCorr()’

             • Table column headers now have all capital letters,

             • minor performance improvements.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’

             • All ‘...’ arguments can now be provided as ‘vector’ or
               ‘list’ to gain more control of the plot appearance,

             • argument ‘abline’ now works also in combination with
               ‘combine = TRUE’ and allows to set ablines independently
               over different plots (#260),

             • automatic axes labelling improved for ‘combine = TRUE’.
