NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.8.0 ( ,2017):

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_Al2O3_ITC()’: Function to analyse data determined
           to correct irradiation times as suggested by Kreutzer et
           al., 2017

         • ‘analyse_Al2O3_CrossTalk()’: Function to analyse data to
           analyse cross talk measurments as shown in Kreutzer et al.,
           2017

         • ‘convert_Activity2Concentration()’: converts nuclide
           activity data (Bq/kg) to concentrations (ppm or %) and vice
           versa

         • ‘convert_RLum2Risoe.BINfileData()’: Function to convert
           ‘RLum.Analysis’ and ‘RLum.Data.Curve’ objects to
           ‘Risoe.BINfileData’, which can be exported to BIN/BINX-files
           using the function ‘write_R2BIN()’.

         • ‘calc_WodaFuchs2008()’: Function to obtain the equivalent
           dose using the approach proposed by Woda and Fuchs, 2008.

         • ‘fit_SurfaceExposure()’: Function to fit eq. 1 in Sohbati et
           al. (2012a) to OSL surface exposure data and derive
           estimates of its parameters (i.a., the age). Alternatively,
           eq. 12 in Sohbati et al. (2012b) can be fitted, which also
           considers the dose rate.

  New example data:

         • ‘ExampleData.SurfaceExposure’: A set of synthetic OSL
           surface exposure dating data to demonstrate the
           fit_SurfaceExposure() functionality. See
           ?ExampleData.SurfaceExposure for details.

  S4-classes and methods:

         • The ‘RLum.Analysis’ show method failed for
           ‘RLum.Data.Spectrum’ objects; fixed.

         • Method for ‘get_RLum’ with signature ‘NULL’ added. Now it
           returns ‘NULL’.

         • The coercion from ‘list’ to ‘RLum.Results’ using ‘as()’ did
           not work; fixed.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Multicore processing now also supports Windows (#47)

             • Fixed a bug where manually specifying the number of CPU
               cores via 'method.control = list(cores = x)' was not
               respected,

             • mixing of curves (e.g., regenerated first, natural
               second) led to a crash of the function, even the new
               structure was correctly specified; fixed (#61).

         • ‘calc_Kars2008()’

             • In some cases the calculated LxTx values of the
               simulated natural dose response curve were slightly
               underestimated and its maximum value differed from the
               individually calculated nN(ss) value. The approach to
               calculate the natural DRC was changed and now yields a
               maximum LxTx value indistinguishable from nN(ss).

             • Numeric output in the plot should now always be inside
               the plotting frame.

             • The number of digits for the numeric output in the plot
               was slightly adjusted.

         • ‘plot_FilterCombinations()’

             • Add interactive mode (‘interactive = TRUE’)

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • The function now turns ‘Inf’ into ‘NA’,

             • the argument ‘na.rm’ is defunct and should not be used
               anymore,

             • minor code modifications to handle special cases such as
               input values with a ‘data.frame’ with no error column,

             • extent examples by for test data set by Berger & Huntley
               (1989).

         • ‘plot_Historgram()’

             • The forwarded argument ‘breaks’ was not treated
               correctly (#54); fixed.

         • ‘plot_RLum()’

             • The function now supports plotting even of highly nested
               lists of `RLum-objects`.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’

             • The option `col` was not working as expected if `black`
               was provided; fixed.

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • The function unexpectetly dropped are warning for an
               unused connection; fixed,

             • if a file link was provided and the argument ‘pattern’
               was set and error was shown; fixed.

         • ‘read_Daybreak2R()’

             • The functions did not work anymore on ASCII files;
               fixed!

         • ‘read_XSYG2R()’

             • Argument ‘verbose’ added for more consistency with other
               functions,

             • the functions now supports the import form files via the
               internet,

             • minor modifications to support minimal examples without
               'recordType',

             • give the XSYG-file import a 50% performance boost,

             • set option `XML_PARSE_HUGE` to allow parsing of larger
               nodes within the XSYG-file.

         • ‘read_SPE2R()’

             • Add support for internet connections.

         • ‘write_R2BIN()’

             • The BIN-file export to version 04 failed in very rare
               cases for ‘NA’ values in the byte position ‘SEQUENCE’;
               fixed,

             • the compatibility mode was extended to limit the maxium
               number of points for one curve to 9,999 (if the option
               is chosen). This gives more compatibility with older
               versions of the Analyst.

  Internals:

         • Start supporting RStudio add-ins for more advanced users.

         • Add fitting test data set by Berger & Huntley (1989) as
           external data.

         • The internal documentation now uses 'markdown'.

         • Internal function `.unlist_RLum()` allows to get rid of
           nested lists.
