NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.4.5 (, 2015):

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • With the (internal) switch from inlinedocs to roxygen2 for
           the package manual compilation, some help page entries for
           our S4-methods got unintentionally lost. Unfortunately this
           remained unnoticed until the package was alread on CRAN.
           This issue has been corrected by picking up some code
           changes we already made for the package version 0.5.0.
           However, this may become confusing in terms of warning
           messages ('deprecated') appearing by using object specific
           'get' or 'set' functions such as ‘get_RLum.Analysis’. The
           function calls are still working, but will be defunct in
           version 0.5.0 and removed in version 0.6.0 or better to say
           become part of more general calls like ‘get_RLum’,
           ‘set_RLum’ and so on. In fact this switch has already been
           made, but the 'old' functions are still supported and the
           warning messages may point on necessary changes in your
           scripts.  Changes in detail:

             • Depraceted S4-generics: ‘set_RLum.Analyis’,
               ‘set_RLum.Data.Curve’, ‘set_RLum.Data.Image’,
               ‘set_RLum.Data.Spectrum’, ‘set_RLum.Results’,
               ‘get_RLum.Analyis’, ‘get_RLum.Data.Curve’,
               ‘get_RLum.Data.Image’, ‘get_RLum.Data.Spectrum’,
               ‘get_RLum.Results’, ‘length_RLum.Analysis’,
               ‘get_structure.RLum.Analysis’.

             • New S4-generics (partly they alreaded existed as plain R
               functions): ‘get_RLum’, ‘set_RLum’, ‘length_RLum’,
               ‘structure_RLum’.

             • This brings the following changes: ‘set_RLum’ now holds
               a argument ‘class’, e.g.: ‘set_RLum(class =
               'RLum.Results', data = data)’

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData’: class definition was updated according
           to changes made in the R version 3.0.0 (without effect for
           the users).

         • All ‘RLum’ classes have been updated according to the
           changes in R version 3.0.0.

         • undefined error using ‘get_RLum(..., keep.object = TRUE)’
           for ‘RLum.Analysis’ objects are corrected (#233).

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Arguments ‘fit.range.min’ and ‘fit.range.max’ have been
               removed and replaced by ‘RF_nat.lim’ and ‘RF_reg.lim’,

             • the argument ‘slide.outlier.rm’ and the underlying
               algorithm were removed from the function as the
               functionality turned out to be unreliable and
               'over-coded' for the intended purpose,

             • argument ‘xlab.unit’ removed (usage of ‘xlab’ is still
               possible),

             • argument ‘fit.MC.runs’ and ‘slide.MC.runs’ replaced by
               ‘n.MC’ (valid for both methods),

             • argument ‘slide.trend.corr’ has been removed and with
               this the underlying code, however, a trend is still
               calculated and used as rejection criteria,

             • argument ‘legend.pos’ moved to the ‘...’ argument,

             • function output ‘class’ containing the original function
               call

             • re-design and unify the function output by removing and
               adding output objects, see manual for further details,

             • the way the error is calculated and returned has been
               changed (see manual for details),

             • add argument ‘txtProgressBar’ (logical),

             • minor graphical adjustments,

             • a lot of internal code polishing.

         • ‘calc_Statistics()’

             • default setting of weights definition changed from 1/s
               to 1/s^2

         • ‘merge_Risoe.BINfileData()’

             • Confusing warning message corrected (#230, Thomas Kolb).

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’

             • zlim-definition bug removed,

             • automatic bandwidth adjustment implemented,

             • automatic z-axis scaling for zero scatter implemented,

             • qr (quartile range) set as default option for scatter
               polygon,

             • option cinn (confidence intervals) changed to pnn
               (percentiles),

             • summary content 'in confidence interval' changed to 'in
               2 sigma',

             • argument central.value renamed to z.0,

             • argument centrality removed,

             • argument bar.col added.

         • ‘plot_KDE()’

             • summary content 'in confidence interval' changed to 'in
               2 sigma'

         • ‘plot_RadialPlot()’

             • summary content 'in confidence interval' changed to 'in
               2 sigma'

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Curve()’

             • NA-test implemented. Nothing is plotted if the curve
               contains NA-values (previous behaviour: function stopped
               with an error).

         • ‘readXSYG2R()’

             • The import will not break any longer if the XSYG file is
               incomplete. Incomplete sequences will be removed from
               the output (incl. terminal feedback).

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Data.Curve()’

             • Corrupt RisoeBINfileData-objects containing no
               measurement data (NPOINTS = 0) no longer cause an error
               during while the RLum.Data.Curve-object is produced.
               Curve x- and y-values are set to NA (BIN-file issue
               Norbert Mercier).

         • ‘writeR2BIN()’

             • Fix some minor issues for if only empty text fields
               (e.g., COMMENT) are provided,

             • implement a function stop for the really rare case that
               someone tries to export a 'Risoe.BINfileData-class'
               object importet in the workspace with an old package
               version and now try to write it back to a BIN-file
               (e.g., the package example data).

  Example data:

             • The ‘Risoe.BINfileData-class’ objects in
               ‘ExampleData.BINfileData’ did not contain a ‘.RESERVED’
               slot for historical reasons.  So far this caused no
               problem, but if one wanted to write the BIN-file
               information back to a file an error occurred; this has
               been fixed now,

             • fix some internal package related example data size
               issues (no effect for the users).

  Internals:

             • Hopefully fix NAMESPACE issue with 'rgdal' package,

             • add imports from base packages as requested by CRAN,

             • further clean-up NAMESPACE file,

             • dependency to package 'zoo' removed for this build, will
               be added again in 0.5.0,

             • add import for package 'assertive' to hopefully provide
               more user friendly error messages.
