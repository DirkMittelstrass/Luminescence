NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.5.0 (, 2015):

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • Extend class definition for ‘RLum’-class by slots
           ‘originator’ and ‘.uid’ (and with that for all
           ‘RLum’classes)

  New functions:

         • ‘calc_gSGC()’ Calculate De value based on the gSGC by Li et
           al., 2015

         • ‘plot_NRt()’ Creates a Natural/Regenerated signal vs. time
           (NR(t)) plot as shown in Steffen et al. 2009

         • ‘read_Daybreak2R()’ Imports data prodcued by a Daybreak
           TL/OSL reader

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • Internal curve selection now works using the ‘get_RLum’.
               This should give a little bit more flexibility and
               prevent errors with odd curve names,

             • in the rare case where no recuperation rate can be
               calculated due to the missing R0 point the function
               stopped with an error. Corrected.
