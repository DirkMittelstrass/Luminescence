NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.5.2 (, 2016):

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • The record index was not re-calulated when the argument
               ‘duplicated.rm’ was used.  This caused some unwanted
               errors in rare cases (reported by Norbert Mercier).
