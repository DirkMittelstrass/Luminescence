           al., 2017

         • ‘analyse_Al2O3_CrossTalk()’: Function to analyse data to

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Multicore processing now also supports Windows (#47)

             • Fixed a bug where manually specifying the number of CPU
               cores via 'method.control = list(cores = x)' was not
               respected

         • ‘plot_FilterCombinations()’

             • Add interative mode (‘interative = TRUE’)
