NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.4.0 (XX XXXX, 2014):

  New S4-classes, methods:

         • ‘RLum.Data.Image’: S4-class for handling image data
           including. Image data in slot ‘data’ are stored as
           ‘RasterBrick’

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Image()’: Set method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Image()’: get method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • further: corresponding show and coercing methods added for
           class ‘RLum.Data.Image’.

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’: Function to analyse post-IR IRSL
           sequence measurements (#133),

         • ‘get_Layout()’: Helper function to return a list with layout
           definitions for more homogenous plotting,

         • ‘get_RLum()’: Wrapper function for various get methods for
           ‘RLum’-objects (#148),

         • ‘merge_RLum.Analysis()’: Function allows merging of
           RLum.Analysis objects and adding of objects an RLum.Analysis
           object consists of (#138),

         • ‘merge_RLum()’: Wrapper function for various merge methods
           for ‘RLum’-objects (#139),

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Image()’: Plot function for
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object.  Function also added to wrapper
           function ‘plot_RLum’

         • ‘readSPE2R()’: Add support Princenton Instruments *.SPE
           files (camera and spectrometer measurements). Function
           output is a ‘RLum.Data.Spectrum’ or ‘RLum.Data.Image’
           object.

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’: Add support for inverse ‘record.id’
           selection, e.g. ‘record.id = -1’ selects all objects except
           the first.

         • ‘get_RLum.Results()’: Add support for data objects for
           objects produced by the function ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()’: If the ‘pos’ value is
           invalid now the function does not return an error any
           longer. Instead ‘NA’ is returned.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’:

             • Correct an error that caused a chrash when ‘xlim’ was
               set in a way that only one wavelength (colour value) was
               remained,

             • correct zebra-colour-pattern for rare cases of ‘xlim’
               settings using ‘plot.type = "persp"’ or ‘plot.type =
               "persp3d"’,

             • add argument new plot type ‘"transect"’ for plotting a
               transect along the time/temperature axis for a specific
               wavelength/channel intervall (#120, requested by Regina
               DeWitt),

             • correct function break for a single column matrix
               (single frame spectrum) by automatically resetting
               ‘plot.type’ to ‘single’ for single frame spectra,

             • colour rug (‘rug = TRUE’) implemented for plot type
               ‘"multiple.lines"’ (#130),

             • argument ‘xaxis.energy’ for wavelength energy conversion
               for 2D plots added (#141).

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’:

             • Minor graphical and code polishing,

             • fix wrong regneration point plotting, if sequence
               contains more then one zero dose point,

             • argument ‘na.exclude’ for the sake consistency replaced
               by ‘na.rm’,

             • proper error message provided if nothing is left after
               ‘NA’ value removal,

             • overshoot of normal distribution curve in MC simulation
               plot corrected (#111),

             • argument ‘output.plotExtended.single’ added allowing a
               single window plot output of all plots,

             • formula of the fitted function is now returend as R
               expression instead of a ‘formula’ object. The return
               object remains, however, ‘Formula’.

         • ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’:

             • Correct an error that causes ‘NA’ values within the
               curve errors for rare combinations of signal and
               background integreation limits,

             • provide a name for the output data frame ‘LxTx.table’
               for the ‘RLum.Results’ object,

             • error fixed for the marginal case that k = 2 and exceed
               the maximal curve length. In that case accidentially no
               error was calculated.

         • ‘fit_CWCurve()’:

             • Implement ‘...’ argument to replace explicit arguments
               ‘ylab’, ‘xlab’ and ‘main’,

               <= 0 (#123 reported by Johanna Lomax),

             • Correct wrong y-axis labelling (wrong channel resolution
               value).

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’:

             • Add ‘...’ support for ‘mtext’,

             • argument ‘method’ added to allow selection between the
               method ‘"FIT"’ and ‘"SLIDE"’. The latter method has been
               newly implemented (#143).

         • ‘plot_Histogram()’:

             • Change default y-axis labelling from 'Counts' to
               'Frequency'

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’:

             • numeric values allowed for parameter centrality,

             • Allow 'IRSL' curves as input to support rough data
               analysis of the post-IR IRSL protocol (#132, Alice
               Versendaal, #140, Georgina King),

             • support multiple recuperation measurements,

             • correct wrong TL curve figure scaling,

             • argument ‘log’ moved to the ‘...’ argument,

             • correct wrong regeneration point numbering (#144),

             • arguments ‘cex’, ‘main’ now supported via the ‘...’
               argument,

             • argument ‘mtext.outer’ added,

             • output object ‘Formula’ added to return the fromula of
               the growth curve,

             • output object ‘De.values’ extended for D01, D02 and
               information on the applied fittin,

             • numerical output extended for information on the choosen
               signal and background integration limits (#122),

             • enhance argument ‘output.plot.single’ for numerical
               values.  This allows to select each single plot output
               individually,

             • details from the argument ‘rejection.criteria’ were
               removed from the argument list to allow a more flexible
               handling (e.g. changing only one parameter at time) and
               to clean up the argument list. However, the argument
               work still as excpected (#145),

             • reformat of rejection criteria output to allow easier
               further treatment,

             • minor bug fixes (e.g., not properly caluculated TL curve

             • Error message implemented for non OSL data sets (#130,
               Georgina King)

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Curve()’:

             • Add argument ‘norm’ to allow for curve normalisation to
               the highest value (#129).

         • ‘calc_MaxDose3()’ & ‘calc_MaxDose4()’:

             • bootstrap method (recycled) as described in Cunningham &
               Wallinga (2012) implemented,

             • upper and lower plot margins of profile log likelihood
               plots decreased,

             • function now iteratively adjusts boundaries for gamma,
               sigma and p0 when one of the estimators reaches the
               lower or upper boundary,

             • new arguments: ‘boundary.sigma’, ‘boundary.gamma’,
               ‘init.values’, ‘...’ (‘bs.M’, ‘bs.N’, ‘bs.h’,
               ‘sigmab.sd’),

             • removed/merged arguments: ‘sigma.xlb’, ‘sigma.xub’,
               ‘gamma.xlb’, ‘gamma.xub’, ‘init.gamma’, ‘init.sigma’,
               ‘init.p0’, ‘output.indices’

         • ‘readBIN2R()’:

             • Integrity checks added to avoid unspecific errors for
               wrong input formats.

         • ‘plot_DRTResults()’:

             • Argument ‘na.exclude’ renamed to ‘na.rm’,

             • by default ylim scaling now is set to the minimum and
               maximum extend of the data set,

             • argument ‘given.dose’ now allows a vector as input,
               e.g., if more then one data set is provided (#156),

             • minor corrections in error handling and graphical
               appearance.

  Internals:

         • Add new dependency for package ‘raster’, which is used for
           the ‘RLum.Data.Image-class’,

         • dependency to package 'Rserve' removed,

         • dependcy to package 'zoo' added.
