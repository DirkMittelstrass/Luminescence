NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.6.1 ( ,2016):

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_baSAR()’

             • Add ‘n.chains’ option to ‘method_control’,

             • add ‘inits’ to ‘method_control’ to set the RNG,

             • add ‘thin’ to ‘method_control’ to control the
               monitoring,

             • account for probable odd use input if the ‘XLS_file’ is
               a ‘data.frame’ (column 1 is of type ‘factor’ instead
               ‘character’),

             • a lots of minor improvements.

         • ‘merge_RisoeBINfileData()’

             • Account for 'implicit list embedding of S4 objects is
               deprecated' warning by changing the code (no visible
               user effect, apart from no visible warning anymore).

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • Move ‘call’ output in the ‘RLum.Results’ output element
               ‘list’.

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • Add suppurt for BIN-file version 8; thanks for the
               support by Kristina Thomsen from Risoe.

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData-class’

             • Add support for BIN-file version 8.

         • ‘write_R2BIN()’

             • Add support for BIN-file version 8.

  S3-generics:

         • The method ‘subset’ for ‘RisoeBINfileData’ objects got a new
           argument ‘records.rm’. If set to ‘FALSE’ curves are only
           selected/deselected, but not removed all.
