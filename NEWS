NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.7.0 ( ,2016):

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_FadingMeasurement()’: Analyse fading measurements
           to calculate g-values and to estimate the density of
           recombination centres.

         • ‘analyse_portableOSL()’: The function analyses CW-OSL curve
           data produced by a SUERC portable OSL reader and produces a
           combined plot of OSL/IRSL signal intensities, OSL/IRSL
           depletion ratios and the IRSL/OSL ratio.

         • ‘calc_Kars2008()’: A function to calculate the expected
           sample specific fraction of saturation following Kars et al.
           (2008) and Huntley (2006).

         • ‘calc_WodaFuchs2008()’: Function to obtain the equivalent
           dose using the approach proposed by Woda and Fuchs, 2008.

         • ‘PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()’: Converts an ‘RLum.Analysis’
           object produced by the function ‘read_PSL2R()’ to an
           ‘Risoe.BINfileData’ object.

         • ‘read_PSL2R()’: Imports PSL files produced by a SUERC
           portable OSL reader into R.

  New example data:

         • ‘ExampleData.fading’: Example data set for fading
           measurements of the IR50, IR100, IR150 and IR225 feldspar
           signals of sample UNIL/NB123. It further contains regular
           equivalent dose measurement data of the same sample, which
           can be used to apply a fading correction to. These data were
           kindly provided by Georgina King.

  Changes in S4-classes and methods:

         • Method ‘get_RLum’ for ‘RLum.Analysis’-objects did not
           respect ‘.pid’, fixed.

         • Method ‘get_RLum’ for ‘list’-objects now accepts lists with
           all kinds of ‘RLum’-objects. Previously, only lists of
           ‘RLum.Analysis’-objects were allowed.

         • ‘plot_RLum’ was not passing the argument ‘sub’, as it was
           fetched by the partial argument matching; fixed.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • Fix wrongly set threshold value for recuperation rate
               (#26).

         • ‘calc_AliquotSize()’

             • Console output can now be suppressed via 'verbose =
               TRUE'.

         • ‘calc_FadingCorr()’

             • Fixed a bug where the function would crash when
               providing an ‘RLum.Results’ object for ‘g_value’.

         • ‘calc_FiniteMixture()’

             • Fixed a bug where certain arguments where not passed to
               `plot_RLum.Results` so that the plot was not as
               customisable as intended.  Thanks to Daniele Questiaux
               for reporting the bug.

         • ‘plot_DetPlot()’

             • Correct negative y-axis, the minimum is now the real
               minimum.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • Reduce number of confusing warning,

             • add new argument ‘mode’ to select the calculation mode
               of the function.  This allows in particular to only fit
               data without calculating a De or calculating a De
               assuming an additive dose reponse curve.

         • ‘plot_RadialPlot()’

             • Sometimes the function crashed with an out of bonds
               error if more than one data set was provided; fixed,

             • argument ‘negatives’ caused an error if not set to
               ‘'remove'’ and fix some errors around this option,

             • argument ‘negatives’ renamed to ‘negatives.rm’ and
               changed to type ‘logical’.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’

             • The interactive plot option was broken with the last
               update of the package 'plotly'; fixed.

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • If BIN-files are automatically imported the function
               skipped non BIN-files without crashing if it is used in
               combination with the argument ‘pattern’.

         • ‘use_DRAC()’

             • Now supports DRAC v1.2 and the newly introduced CSV
               input template.  Older v1.1 excel sheet input templates
               are still supported, but users are highly encouraged to
               use the new CSV file.

  Internals:

         • The internal function converting BIN-file curves to
           RLum.Data.Curve() objects had been optimised and, amongst
           others, now uses a function written using Rcpp to create the
           curve matrix.  The conversion now works ca. two times
           faster,

         • add ‘`[<-]`’ method for ‘RLum.Data.Curve’ objects,

         • a hint on how to cite a function is now added automatically
           to every major function manual page.
