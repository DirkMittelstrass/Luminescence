NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.5.2 (, 2016):

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • Fix graphical output for MET protocol.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • The function partly couldn't fit if negative weights had
               been provided, fixed (thanks to Norbert Mercier).

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’

             • Argument 'norm' did not work for single curves,
               corrected (#261).

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • The record index was not re-calulated when the argument
               ‘duplicated.rm’ was used.  This caused some unwanted
               errors in rare cases (reported by Norbert Mercier).
