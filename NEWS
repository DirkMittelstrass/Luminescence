NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.8.0 ( ,2017):

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_Al2O3_ITC()’: Function to analyse data determined
           to correct irradiation times as suggested by Kreutzer et
           al., 2017

         • ‘analyse_Al2O3_CrossTalk()’: Function to analyse data to
           analyse cross talk measurments as shown in Kreutzer et al.,
           2017

         • ‘convert_Activity2Concentration()’: converts nuclide
           activity data (Bq/kg) to concentrations (ppm or %) and vice
           versa

         • ‘convert_RLum2RisoeBIN’

         • ‘calc_WodaFuchs2008()’: Function to obtain the equivalent
           dose using the approach proposed by Woda and Fuchs, 2008.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Multicore processing now also supports Windows (#47)

             • Fixed a bug where manually specifying the number of CPU
               cores via 'method.control = list(cores = x)' was not
               respected

         • ‘plot_FilterCombinations()’

             • Add interative mode (‘interative = TRUE’)

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • The function now turns ‘Inf’ into ‘NA’,

             • the argument ‘na.rm’ is defunct and should not be used
               anymore,

             • minor code modifications to handle special cases such as
               input values with a ‘data.frame’ with no error column,

             • extent examples by for test data set by Berger & Huntley
               (1989).

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • The function unexpectetly dropped are warning for an
               unused connection; fixed,

             • if a file link was provided and the argument ‘pattern’
               was set and error was shown; fixed.

         • ‘read_XSYG2R()’

             • Argument ‘verbose’ added for more consistency with other
               functions,

             • the functions now supports the import form files via the
               internet,

             • minor modifications to support minimal examples without
               'recordType',

             • give the XSYG-file import a 50% performance boost.

  S4 and Internals:

         • The ‘RLum.Analysis’ show method failed for
           ‘RLum.Data.Spectrum’ objects; fixed.

         • Method for ‘get_RLum’ with signature ‘NULL’ added. Now it
           returns ‘NULL’

         • Start supporting RStudio add-ins for more advanced users.

         • Add fitting test data set by Berger & Huntley (1989) as
           external data
