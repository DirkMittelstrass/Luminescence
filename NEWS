NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.7.0 ( ,2016):

  New functions:

         • ‘analyse_FadingMeasurement()’: Analyse fading measurements
           to calculate g-values and to estimate the density of
           recombination centres.

         • ‘analyse_portableOSL()’: The function analyses CW-OSL curve
           data produced by a SUERC portable OSL reader and produces a
           combined plot of OSL/IRSL signal intensities, OSL/IRSL
           depletion ratios and the IRSL/OSL ratio.

         • ‘calc_Kars2008()’: A function to calculate the expected
           sample specific fraction of saturation following Kars et al.
           (2008) and Huntley (2006).

         • ‘calc_WodaFuchs2008()’: Function to obtain the equivalent
           dose using the approach proposed by Woda and Fuchs, 2008.

         • ‘PSL2Risoe.BINfileData()’: Converts an ‘RLum.Analysis’
           object produced by the function ‘read_PSL2R()’ to an
           ‘Risoe.BINfileData’ object (BETA).

         • ‘read_PSL2R()’: Imports PSL files produced by a SUERC
           portable OSL reader into R (BETA).

  New example data:

         • ‘ExampleData.fading’: Example data set for fading
           measurements of the IR50, IR100, IR150 and IR225 feldspar
           signals of sample UNIL/NB123. It further contains regular
           equivalent dose measurement data of the same sample, which
           can be used to apply a fading correction to. These data were
           kindly provided by Georgina King.

  Changes in S4-classes and methods:

         • Method ‘get_RLum’ for ‘RLum.Analysis’-objects did not
           respect ‘.pid’, fixed.

         • ‘plot_RLum’ was not passing the argument ‘sub’, as it was
           fetched by the partial argument matching; fixed.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘calc_AliquotSize()’

             • Console output can now be suppressed via 'verbose =
               TRUE'.

         • ‘calc_FadingCorr()’

             • Fixed a bug where the function would crash when
               providing an ‘RLum.Results’ object for ‘g_value’.

         • ‘plot_DetPlot()’

             • Correct negative y-axis, the minimum is now the real
               minimum.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • Reduce number of confusing warning,

             • add new argument ‘mode’ to select the calculation mode
               of the function.  This allows in particular to only fit
               data without calculating a De or calculating a De
               assuming an additive dose reponse curve.

         • ‘plot_RadialPlot()’

             • Sometimes the function crashed with an out of bonds
               error if more than one data set was provided; fixed.

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • If BIN-files are automatically imported the function
               skipped non BIN-files without crashing if it is used in
               combination with the argument ‘pattern’.

  Internals:

         • The internal function converting BIN-file curves to
           RLum.Data.Curve() objects had been optimised and, amongst
           others, now uses a function written using Rcpp to create the
           curve matrix.  The conversion now works ca. two times
           faster,

         • add ‘`[<-]`’ method for ‘RLum.Data.Curve’ objects,

         • a hint on how to cite a function is now added automatically
           to every major function manual page.
