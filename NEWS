NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.6.2 (,2016):

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Test parameter ‘curves_bounds’ was not calculated
               correctly; fixed,

             • first output object renamed to ‘data’, instead of
               ‘De.values’.

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • The first object in the returned ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               was renamed to ‘data’ to gain consistency with the other
               functions.

         • ‘analyse_SAR.TL()’

             • The first object in the returned ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               was renamed to ‘data’ to gain consistency with the other
               functions.

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • The first object in the returned ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               was renamed to ‘data’ to gain consistency with the other
               functions.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • ‘fit.method’ set to linear for problematic cases (two
               reg points).

         • ‘plot_Histogram()’

             • Fix a problem while dealing with ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               as input (#7, thanks to Alice Versendaal).

         • ‘plot_KDE()’

             • Fix a problem while dealing with ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               as input (#7, thanks to Alice Versendaal),

             • function will not break any longe if only one point is
               provided, but in this case no density curve is returned.
