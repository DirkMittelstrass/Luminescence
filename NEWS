NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.6.0 (,2016):

  New functions:

         • ‘plot_DetPlot()’: Plots the equivalent dose (De) in
           dependency of the chosen signal integral (cf. Bailey et al.,
           2003; #23).

  Removed functions:

         • ‘readBIN2R()’, replacement ‘read_BIN2R()’,

         • ‘readSPE2R()’, replacement ‘read_SPE2R()’,

         • ‘readXSYG2R()’, replacement ‘read_XSYG2R()’,

         • ‘writeR2BIN()’, replacement ‘write_R2BIN()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Curve()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Image()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Analysis()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘get_RLum.Results()’, replacement ‘get_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Curve()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Image()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Analysis()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘set_RLum.Results()’, replacement ‘set_RLum()’,

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Data.Curve’, replacement
           ‘.Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Data.Curve’ The function was made
           an internal function, as this function was used only rarely
           by users, but often needed internally. The function and its
           functionally is still available under its new name but a lot
           of integrity checks had been removed from the code, which
           doubles the speed when transforming objects, but makes the
           function failing fast.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • The function now checks more strict for allowed record
               types ('OSL' or 'IRSL'). At the same time the function
               will not stop with an error if no such record type is
               detected, but return ‘NULL’ and print a warning. This
               was necessary to prevent a misuse of the function, which
               may end up in undesiered (wrong) results,

             • under really rare circumstances, many recycling points
               and recuperation points the function could crash
               (fixed).

         • ‘apply_CosmicRayRemoval()’

             • Argument ‘silent’ renamed to ‘verbose’,

             • new argument ‘method.Pych.threshold_factor’ added to
               have a better control for the threshold value used for
               the removal,

             • new argument ‘MARGIN’ added to allow the application of
               the methods along the wavelength or the time.

         • ‘calc_FadingCorr()’

             • Table column headers now have all capital letters,

             • minor performance improvements.

         • ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’

             • New argument ‘digits’ introduced to allow direct
               rounding of the numbers,

             • add argument ‘sig0’ to allow for an extra component of
               error.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Analysis()’

             • All ‘...’ arguments can now be provided as ‘vector’ or
               ‘list’ to gain more control of the plot appearance,

             • argument ‘abline’ now works also in combination with
               ‘combine = TRUE’ and allows to set ablines independently
               over different plots (#260),

             • automatic axes labelling improved for ‘combine = TRUE’,

             • support further ‘...’ argument ‘legend’ (TRUE/FALSE).

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • If the input data contain a least one infinite value the
               function will not crash any longer, but return ‘NULL’
               (#263, Norbert Mercier),

             • check for insufficient values in the data set and return
               ‘NULL’ prior a function crash.

         • ‘merge_RLum.Data.Curve()’

             • Support further merge operations: ‘median’, ‘var’, ‘sd’,
               ‘min’, ‘max’.

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • Handling of corrupt BIN-files improved, the functions
               tries to import whatever possible,

             • the argument ‘n.records’ was not respected under rare
               circumstances.

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()’

             • Single grain data had not been converted correctly to
               ‘RLum.Analysis’ objects.  Each grain within a position
               should represent one ‘RLum.Analysis’ object with a set
               of curve. This was so far not the case; corrected.
