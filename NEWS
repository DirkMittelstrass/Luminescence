NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.4.0 (XX XXXX, 2014):

  New S4-classes, methods:

         • ‘RLum.Data.Image’: S4-class for handling image data
           including. Image data in slot ‘data’ are stored as
           ‘RasterBrick’

         • ‘set_RLum.Data.Image()’: Set method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • ‘get_RLum.Data.Image()’: get method for class
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’

         • further: corresponding show and coercing methods added for
           class.

  New functions:

         • ‘readSPE2R()’: Add support Princenton Instruments *.SPE
           files (camera and spectrometer measurements). Function
           output is a ‘RLum.Data.Spectrum’ or ‘RLum.Data.Image’
           object.

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Image()’: Plot function for
           ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object.  Function also added to wrapper
           function ‘plot_RLum’

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • ‘get_RLum.Results()’: Add support for data objects for
           objects produced by the function ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()’: If the ‘pos’ value is
           invalid now the function does not return an error any
           longer. Instead ‘NA’ is returned.

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()’:

             • Correct an error that caused a chrash when ‘xlim’ was
               set in a way that only one wavelength (colour value) was
               remained,

             • correct zebra-colour-pattern for rare cases of ‘xlim’
               settings using ‘plot.type = "persp"’ or ‘plot.type =
               "persp3d"’,

             • add argument new plot type ‘"transect"’ for plotting a
               transect along the time/temperature axis for a specific
               wavelength/channel intervall (#120, requested by Regina
               DeWitt),

             • correct function break for a single column matrix
               (single frame spectrum) by automatically resetting
               ‘plot.type’ to ‘single’ for single frame spectra.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’:

             • Minor graphical and code polishing,

         • ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’:

             • Correct an error that causes ‘NA’ values within the
               curve errors for rare combinations of signal and
               background integreation limits,

             • provide a name for the output data frame ‘LxTx.table’
               for the ‘RLum.Results’ object

         • ‘fit_CWCurve()’:

             • Implement ‘...’ argument to replace explicit arguments
               ‘ylab’, ‘xlab’ and ‘main’,

             • Fix an issue that causes an error when input values were
               <= 0 (#123 reported by Johanna Lomax),

             • Correct wrong y-axis labelling (wrong channel resolution
               value).

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’:

             • Add ‘...’ support for ‘mtext’

         • ‘plot_Histogram()’:

             • Change default y-axis labelling from 'Counts' to
               'Frequency'

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’:

             • Clarify behaviour when no OSL curve is provided;
               function now stops with an error (#132, reported by
               Alice Versendaal)

         • ‘plot_RLum.Data.Curve()’:

             • Add argument ‘norm’ to allow for curve normalisation to
               the highest value (#129)

  Internals:

         • Add new dependency for package ‘raster’, which is used for
           the ‘RLum.Data.Image-class’
