NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.5.0 (, 2015):

  Changes S4-objects, methods, classes:

         • Extend class definition for 'RLum'-class by slots
           'originator' and '.uid' (and with that for all
           'RLum'classes),

         • 'get_RLum'

             • the method for the 'RLum.Results' object returned 'NULL'
               if nothing was defined for a specific function,
               corrected. Now, if nothing is defined the first object
               in the slot 'data' is returned (#223),

             • the method was enhanced to deal with objects of type
               'list' containing only 'RLum' objects. Depending on the
               'RLum' objects in the list the corresponding 'get_RLum'
               methods are called.

         • 'Risoe.BINfileData-class'

             • Show method now returns the valid grain range.

  New functions:

         • 'calc_gSGC()' Calculate De value based on the gSGC by Li et
           al., 2015

         • 'plot_NRt()' Creates a Natural/Regenerated signal vs. time
           (NR(t)) plot as shown in Steffen et al. 2009

         • 'read_Daybreak2R()' Imports ASCII data produced by a
           Daybreak TL/OSL reader

         • 'use_DRAC()' Provides an R interface to the 'Dose Rate
           Calculator' (DRAC)

         • 'template_DRAC()' Creates a DRAC input template (v1.1) to be
           used for 'use_DRAC()'

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • 'analyse_SAR.CWOSL()'

             • Internal curve selection now works using the 'get_RLum'.
               This should give a little bit more flexibility and
               prevent errors with odd curve names,

             • in the rare case where no recuperation rate can be
               calculated due to the missing R0 point the function
               stopped with an error. This has been corrected.

             • function now how to deal with a 'list' of
               'RLum.Analysis' objects and will re-call itself as
               elements are in the 'list' (argument 'object'). In
               particular cases this may lead to a tremendous efficient
               data analysis process,

             • add 'call' to data output object,

             • add 'UID' column to data object 'De.values' and
               'rejection.criteria'.

         • 'calc_Statistics()'

             • Weighted median is now completly removed from the
               calculation, values is replaced by the unweighted
               median.

         • 'fit_LMCurve()'

             • Argument 'output.plot' renamed to 'plot',

             • argument 'output.plotBG' renamed to 'plot.BG',

             • arguemtn 'output.terminal' renamed to 'verbose',

             • argument 'output.path' removed without replacement,
               corresponding code has been removed from the function,

             • argument 'cex.global' removed, scaling can be still used
               via 'cex'

             • argument 'output.terminaladvanced' has been removed
               without replacement, terminal output can just be
               triggered via 'verbose',

             • new argument added 'fit.method'. Argument works similar
               as in 'fit_CWCurve()' and allows to use the
               Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for fitting (addressing
               #55)

             • new return data object added 'call' containing the
               original function call.

         • 'plot_AbanicoPlot()'

             • Further adjustment to deal with zero values (will now be
               removed automatically)

         • 'plot_GrowthCurve()'

             • Final fitting and fitting during the MC runs is now done
               using the Levenberg-Marquardt from the package
               'minpack.lm'. This increases the fitting stability and
               the computation step markedly (#5),

             • output object is enhanced by the 'call' containing the
               function call,

             • for the option 'fit.method = "LIN"' and 'fit.method =
               "EXP OR LIN"' weights had been not considered;
               corrected,

             • add argument 'fit.force_through_origin', it does exactly
               what you may expect from such argument (#225, requested
               by Alice Versendaal),

             • get rid of some not very informative warning messages if
               some fitting failed.

         • 'plot_RLum()'

             • The '...' argument 'main' can be now be of type 'list'
               if a 'list' of objects is provided. This allows to set
               different plot titles for this specific plot option.

         • 'plot_RLum.Analysis()'

             • The '...' argument 'main' can now be provided as vector
               if 'combine = TRUE'.

         • 'readBIN2R()'

             • Set function on deprecated, new name: 'read_BIN2R()'

         • 'readSPE2R()'

             • Set function on deprecated, new name: 'read_SPE2R()'

         • 'readXSYG2R()'

             • Set function to deprecated, new name: 'read_XSYG2R()'

         • 'Risoe.BINfileData2RLum.Analysis()'

             • A new argument 'grain' can be used to further limit the
               transformation to specific grains in the data set,

             • the arguement 'pos' is no longer required. If nothing is
               provided every position will be transformed and the
               function returns a list of 'RLum.Analysis'-objects,

             • along with this the argument 'pos' now accepts a vector
               as input (i.e., more than on position can be provided
               for the conversion),

             • new argument 'txtProgressBar' addd. The default is set
               to 'FALSE' as the computation time just become relevant
               for single grain data,

             • an error was fixed that occurred if the curves used for
               the transformation had been of zero length.

         • 'writeR2BIN()'

             • Set function to deprecated, new name: 'write_R2BIN()'

  Internals:

         • Re-adding the package 'zoo' in imports,

         • Adding package 'readxl' to imports (used in 'use_DRAC' to
           import the XLS file)

         • Adding package 'httr' to imports (used in 'use_DRAC' to
           establish the connection)

         • Fixed a bug in 'RLum.Data.Image' class that most likely
           caused the 'rgdal' NAMESPACE issue

         • Added methods for S3 generics '`$`, `[<-`, `[[<-`, print,
           as.data.frame' for objects of class 'DRAC.list'

         • Added methods for S3 generics 'print' for objects of class
           'DRAC.highlights'

         • Roxygen2: replaced '@exportPattern ^[[:alpha:]]+' with with
           explicit '@export' statements to allow better NAMESPACE
           housekeeping
