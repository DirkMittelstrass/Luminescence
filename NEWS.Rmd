## Changes in version `r version_number` (`r Sys.Date()`)

### New functions

* `fit_OSLLifeTimes()` Fit and deconvolution of OSL lifetimes using off-time measurements,
i.e. after the stimulation was switched off.
* `plot_DRCSummary()` Summarise all dose-response curves from your SAR OSL 
analysis in one single plot.
* `scale_GammaDose()` Scale the gamma dose rate considering layer-to-layer variations
in soil radioactivity. Contributed by S. Riedesel and M. Autzen.
* `fit_ThermalQuenching()` Provide an easy option to fit thermal quenching data and      determine the activation energy.
* read_RF2R()` Add support for importing spatially resolved RF measurement results.

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurements()`
* Enable support for data imported from a BIN/BINX-file.

#### `read_BIN2R()`
* In the autofile recognition (only a path instead of a file is provided), sometimes the found BIN/BINX-files were imported twice. The corresponding code was simplified to avoid such errors in future.
