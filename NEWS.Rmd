## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires at least R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` 
* If run in a loop (e.g., with `lapply()`), merging of the results with `merge_RLum()` failed, 
because the returned objects were not always strictly identical; fixed. 

#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()` 
* If all dose points were 0, the function crashed; fixed.

#### `read_BIN2R()`
* The function crashed if it was run in a loop and encountered non-supported files; fixed.
* The function does not crash anymore for zero-byte files but skips the import, returns a message and `NULL`.
