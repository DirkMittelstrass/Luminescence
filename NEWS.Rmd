## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

** This package version requires at least R >= 4.0.5 **

### New functions


### Bugfixes and changes
#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`
* Apparently the function never worked as intended for `XSYG` files; fixed. 
To prevent further problems, a test was added that monitors this functionality.

#### `verify_SingleGrainData()`
* Improve terminal and plot output
* Add minimal support for `...` to control plot output if wanted

### Internals
* `mclust` added as new package dependency to support the new Bayesian models
