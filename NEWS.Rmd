## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires at least R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `calc_AverageDose()`
* The function aggressively reset plot areas also in cases nothing was plotted; fixed. 

#### `plot_AbanicoPlot()`
* If the input was of type `data.frame` the function struggled if the `data.frame` 
had more than two columns. While this was clearly indicated in the documentation, 
the behaviour was annoying, because it made always an extra sub-setting necessary 
when working with `data.frame`s comprising more than two columns. Now the function discards
all other columns except for the first two if the input is a `data.frame`.

#### `plot_GrowthCurve()`
* The function crashed if `fit.method = "LambertW"` and the `Ln/Tn` largely 
exceeded the highest `Lx/Tx` point; fixed.
