# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## Bugfixes and changes

### `analyse_Al2O3C_Measurement()`
* Add support for sequences **without** TL curves in the sequence; however, the
function still expects three OSL curves for natural, regenerated, and background signal. 

### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`
* Add support for `...` arguments `las` and `axes`

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`
* The `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` had two 
long-standing issues with the colour rug (both are fixed):
  * The colour rug showed ugly overplotting, 
  * the colour rug had a resolution that depended on the x-axis (wavelength) scaling. 
  
* `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` now support 
a `...` parameter `box` for removing the outer plot frame. The argument
was named `box` to avoid a confusion with the term frames used for image stacks. 

* `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` now support 
a `...` parameter `frames` for picking the frames to be visualised beyond the 
axis limitation. 

### `read_BIN2R()`
* The example in the documentation was a little bit too generic and is now replaced by an example
that works. 

### `write_R2BIN()`
* The running example was not working because it used outdated example data. The example
was replaced by a working example using an actual BINX-file.
(thanks @JohannesFriedrich for reporting, #110)

## Internals
* Add new internal function `.add_fancy_log_axis()` to provide a more sophisticated 
log-axis to plots if needed with minor ticks and proper labelling.
