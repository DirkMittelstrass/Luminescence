# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.1**

## Bugfixes and changes

### `fit_LMCurve()`
* If the argument `fit.calcError` was set to `TRUE` and the parameter confidence interval 
calculation failed, the function stopped with an uncontrolled error. Now it shows a meaningful 
warning instead. 

### `plot_RadialPlot()`
* Fix a few visual problems if the dataset has negative values (thanks to Alice Versendaal for reporting)

### `read_BIN2R()`
* Function crashed under edge conditions while testing very short records returning a 
subscript out of bounds error; fixed.

### Internals
* Fix outdated URL in `github.R`
