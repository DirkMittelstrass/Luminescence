# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

## Bugfixes and changes

### `plot_RLum.Data.Curve()`
* Add support for `...`. arguments `las` and `axes`

### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`
* The `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` had two 
long-standing issues with the colour rug. (1) the colour rug showed ugly overplotting, 
(2) the colour rug had a resolution that depended on the x-axis (wavelength)
scaling. Both issues were fixed.
* `plot.types = 'single` and `plot.type = "multiple.lines"` now support 
a `...` parameter `box` for removing the outer plot frame. The argument
was named `box` to avoid a confusion with the term frames used for image stacks. 

## Internals
* Add new internal function `.add_fancy_log_axis()` to provide a more sophisticated 
log-axis to plots if needed with minor ticks and proper labelling.
