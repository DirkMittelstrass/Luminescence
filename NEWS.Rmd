# Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`
* Fixed a bug that let `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()` crash under very particular circumstances 
due to a wrong conditional statement.
* If the count limits are oddly chosen, i.e. `limit_counts` is smaller than the actual 
number of counts on the z-scale, the function does not crash anymore but replaces the value
with the lowest possible value. 
* The argument `box` for the plot `persp` now accepts `alternate` for customized plot without 
the box usually drawn around the plot.
* The function now returns adjusted matrix used for the plotting regardless of whether 
the argument `plot` is set to `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
* If the plot type is `persp`, the default, the "viewing transformation matrix" is returned
as a attribute `pmat`. This can be further used in conjunction with the function `graphics::trans3d`
to add additional information to the graphic.

#### `plot_FilterCombinations()`
* The function returned a wrongly calculated optical density, using `log()` instead of `log10`; fixed.= 
Note: The filter shiny app was not immediately affected, because the values here were taken from a spreadsheet. 
* The output object is now invisible, since the main purpose of the function is to plot a graphic and not to return an object.
