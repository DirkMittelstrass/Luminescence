## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

** This package version requires at least R >= 4.0.5 **

### New functions
* `combine_Dr_De()` This function allows to model dose rate and equivalent dose distributions 
to obtain an age from Bayesian modelling using both distributions. In the back a couple of 
additional functions have been added to support this novel approach. This function requires [JAGS](https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io) (supported through `'rjags'`) on your computer along with a 
couple of other R packages prompted to you when you first try to use this function. 

* `plot_OSLAgeSummary()` Posterior distribution plot of ages. This function is used by `combine_Dr_Dr()`, however, it can be used as stand-alone plot.

### Bugfixes and changes
#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()`
* Apparently the function never worked as intended for `XSYG` files; fixed. 
To prevent further problems, a test was added that monitors this functionality.
* The parameter `t_star` now supports `half_complex`, which uses the long equation
from Auclair et al. (2003). The difference is of theoretical nature, however, now 
the two values can be compared.

#### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`
* The function gained a new argument `records_max` enabling only a limited number of curves
to be shown in the mode `combe = TRUE`. This avoids that a large number of curves become indistinguishable. 
The first and the last curve are always shown, all other curves are shown following an evenly distributed index 
interval. 

#### `verify_SingleGrainData()`
* Improve terminal and plot output
* Add minimal support for `...` to control plot output if wanted

### Internals
* `mclust` added as new package dependency to support the new Bayesian models
