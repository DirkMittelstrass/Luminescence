## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires at least R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `analyse_FadingMeasurement()` 
* If run in a loop (e.g., with `lapply()`), merging of the results with `merge_RLum()` failed, 
because the returned objects were not always strictly identical; fixed. 

#### `analyse_SAR.CWOSL()` 
* If all dose points were 0, the function crashed; fixed.

#### `calc_CentralDose()` 
* The output in element `output$summary` was confusing for `log = FALSE`. While 
the terminal output was correct, no differentiation was made between absolute
and relative values in the output object depending on the `log` mode. 
Now two more columns were added to report the overdispersion always in absolute units
(whatever that may be) and relative (thanks to Li Bo for reporting this problem).
* No claim on the unit (e.g., Gy or s) is anymore made in the terminal output because
we do not determine this information. Instead now 'abs.' for absolute is used.

#### `read_BIN2R()`
* The function crashed if it was run in a loop and encountered non-supported files; fixed.
* The function does not crash anymore for zero-byte files but skips the import, returns a message and `NULL`.
* For BINX files created using and EM-CCD camera the function created, under particular circumstances, invalid records that could not be further transformed; fixed (thanks to  Anna-Maartje de Boer for reporting).

#### `plot_RadialPlot()`
* The function does not mess anymore with the `par()` settings of other subsequent plots
