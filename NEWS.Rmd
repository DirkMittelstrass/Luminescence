## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `plot_RadioPlot()`
* An additional line, e.g., `plot_RadialPlot(...,line = 1)` was not always drawn where the user expected it to be seen; fixed (#106, reported by Li Bo)
* The radial z-scale did not always extend to the limits of the data, even if limits for the z-scale were set, leading to an odd graphical offset and unsuitable plots; fixed (reported by Christina Neudorf)
* The plot now always draws the lower limit of the z-scale. 

#### `calc_MinDose()`/`calc_MaxDose()`
* The error message if no likelihood profiling can be done is now more clear.
