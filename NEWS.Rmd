## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `plot_RadioPlot()`
* An additional line, e.g., `plot_RadialPlot(...,line = 1)` was not always drawn where the user expected it to be seen; fixed (#106, reported by Li Bo)
* The radial z-scale did not always extend to the limits of the data, even if limits for the z-scale were set, leading to an odd graphical offset and unsuitable plots; fixed (reported by Christina Neudorf)
* The plot now always draws the lower limit of the z-scale. 

#### `calc_MinDose()`/`calc_MaxDose()`
* The error message if no likelihood profiling can be done now reads more clear. 

#### `fit_EmissionSpectra()` 
* `method_control = list()` gained a new sub-argument `norm` to enable/disable
the normalisation of the data. The default is `TRUE`. 

#### `plot_RLum.Analysis()`
* The parameter `records_max` removed more curves than required; fixed. 

#### `plot_RLum.Data.Spectrum()`
* The function gained a new argument `plot` that can be used to disable the plot
and return the matrix used for the plotting instead. This may sound a little bit awkward, but
it adds an enormous flexibility. The function does a lot of internal transformations, 
such as binning or colour calculations, which could not be used in other functions before. 
Now the function can be 'misused' to create the an output object ready to be passed to other
packages and functions, such as the package `'plot3D'`.
