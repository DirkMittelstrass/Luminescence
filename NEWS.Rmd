## Changes in version `r RLumBuild::.get_pkg_version()` (`r Sys.Date()`)

**This package version requires at least R >= 4.0.5**

### Bugfixes and changes

#### `read_BIN2R()`
* The function crashed if it was run in a loop and encountered non-supported files; fixed.
* The function does not crash anymore for zero-byte files but skips the import, returns a message and `NULL`.
